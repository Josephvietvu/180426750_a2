      <h1>Browser Cache</h1>
        <p>Browser Cache is a temporary storage that holds several contents and data when browsing through the internet.
      An example would be saving your username and password for netflix or youtube. Clearing cache is essentially deleting all the saved contents
    and data, so the next time you log into netflix or any platform that you've submitted information, it will require you to submit your username and password once again. So in the context
    of the mailchimp form, clearing the cache will ask you to submit your email, username, and password whene you vist the site subsequently. If you decided not to clear your cache the mailchimp would not pop up simply because
    your data from your previous vist has been saved so there is no need to submit again.
